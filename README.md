# Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction
## Abstract:
- Health care field has a vast amount of data, for processing those data certain techniques are used. Data mining is one of the techniques often used. 
- Heart disease is the Leading cause of death worldwide. This System predicts the arising possibilities of Heart Disease. 
- The outcomes of this system provide the chances of occurring heart disease in terms of percentage. 
- The datasets used are classified in terms of medical parameters. This system evaluates those parameters using data mining classification technique. 
- The datasets are processed in python programming using three main Machine Learning Algorithm namely Random Forest Algorithm, Naive Bayes Algorithm and K-Nearest neighbors which   shows the best algorithm among these two in terms of accuracy level of heart disease.

## Description about the dataset:
- Age : Age of the patient
- Sex : Sex of the patient
- exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- ca: number of major vessels (0-3)
- cp : Chest Pain type chest pain type
- Value 1: typical angina
- Value 2: atypical angina
- Value 3: non-anginal pain
- Value 4: asymptomatic
- trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- chol : cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor
- fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
- rest_ecg : resting electrocardiographic results
- Value 0: normal
- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
- thalach : maximum heart rate achieved

- target : 0= less chance of heart attack, 1= more chance of heart attack
