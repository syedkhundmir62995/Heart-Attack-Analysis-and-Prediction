# Prediction-of-Heart-Disease
## Abstract:
- Health care field has a vast amount of data, for processing those data certain techniques are used. Data mining is one of the techniques often used. 
- Heart disease is the Leading cause of death worldwide. This System predicts the arising possibilities of Heart Disease. 
- The outcomes of this system provide the chances of occurring heart disease in terms of percentage. 
- The datasets used are classified in terms of medical parameters. This system evaluates those parameters using data mining classification technique. 
- The datasets are processed in python programming using three main Machine Learning Algorithm namely Random Forest Algorithm, Naive Bayes Algorithm and K-Nearest neighbors which   shows the best algorithm among these two in terms of accuracy level of heart disease.
